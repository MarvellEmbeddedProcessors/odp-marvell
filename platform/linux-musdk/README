1. Intro

OpenDataPlane implementation for Armada 7k/8k SoC's.
Current version supports HW buffer manager, TX/RX queues, Packet IO (no Crypto API
supported). This drop does not target high performance. It is rather proof of
ODP API pktio functionality. It still uses linux-generic's SW scheduler.

2. ODP build-time dependecies

ODP-MUSDK is based on Marvell User-Space SDK (MUSDK) library.

Please refer to the doc/ directory in MUSDK library for instructions about MUSDK library and its
dependencies:

3. ODP build

  3.1 Packages

The following packages may be needed:
- gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
- g++-aarch64-linux-gnu

  3.2 Build process

 - ./bootstrap
 - ./configure --host=aarch64-linux-gnu --prefix=<odp-install-path> --with-openssl-path=<open-ssl-install-path> --with-platform=linux-musdk
        --with-sdk-install-path=<musdk-install-path> --enable-mvpp2-support  --enable-static --disable-shared
 - make
 - make install

4. ODP run-time dependencies

  4.1 U-boot

Sources:            TBD
Tag:                TBD
config:             TBD
Build instructions: TBD

  4.3 Linux kernel

Sources: TBD
Tag:     TBD
config:  TBD
DTB:     TBD

Current ODP implementation can co-exist with Ethernet slow path implementation
if this has been patched for CPU0 isolation.

TODO: Add here references to patch location

The Packet Processor resources are statically shared between Linux slow path
driver and ODP implementation (build time configuration).

TODO: We have to specify here if the ODP-MUSDK should be used differently if
the slow path is active or not


  4.3 MUSDK

Parts are built along with McSDK libraries (see item #2.1 of this instruction)

- MUSDK library
- UIO & pp2_tmp kernel module

4. Limitations

Cripto and classifer API are not implemented
